Analysis of Housing attributes such as lot size (SQFT), living space (SQFT), and scenic view rating (scale of 1-5). The purpose of this analysis is to measure the correlation between these attributes and the selling prices of homes in Washington State in the year of 2014. Examining the regression analysis of these attributes will help build a predictive model in the future when attempting to make inferences on prices. Another component of this analysis includes housing price in 2014 based on the year the house was built. A lot of the fluctuations are due to renovations, so comparing properties with similar attributes we can see the impact of renovations on housing price. This dataset did present some limitations such as ambiguity in the data attributes names. For the purpose of this analysis we made the assumptions that “living sqft” is living space and “view” is a scenic view ranking.
